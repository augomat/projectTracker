EventRefactoring  
  Refactor Msgs so that they are only in Balloon instead of when creating the event
  Port SaveOnExit
  Port ExitCSV
D Handle CSV write exceptions
D Port Worktimebreaks
D Abstract from form1
  Have a look at all RTODOs
  Kick Tracker
D Implement InMemoryStorage
D   Implement splitting & changing of types
  Make ProjectObject that describes itwith properties?
  Locking?!
  Analysis should not throw 'Project corrected'
  Refactor Prompt out of NotifierLockscreen into Processor/Subscriber such that it can react to GoodMorning differently
    Therefor I probably need to introduce IDs into the Events so that I can react to the GoodMorning but not the the original Start
      That makes an explicit assumption about the order of processing of the events
      Or I just let GoodMorning change/set (and not refire) the event
  When coming back from a meeting, Bubble shouldn't Show 'Break: 88min'
T Fix 'Somethinig happened with project'
  Where does Project [unknown] come frome (11.01.)
    SessionSwitchReason.SessionUnlock is not (always?) triggered when logging in with RDP, thus project is still [unknown] from Finish
T Show Mins instead of secs in chart
T Worktimebreak left bubble should be in mins instead of secs
  Retrieve Outlook Appointments, check whether they fall into a Break and offer correction in case they do
  Workstore Errors are not Shown in Bubbles on Win 8?!?!
_ Why is there a SalesF Pj in Pj corrected list if the real Pj-name is 'CRM'?
    -> Has to be corrected manually in app.config
  Refactor ProjectChangeEvent to not include WorktimeRec but make it separate & and then pass PjChEvent to Storages so they can decide to write out FALSE for screentime and create their own WorktimeRecs
  Refactor BalloonInformant to have internal delegates in a hashmap <ChangeEventType, Delegate> to get rid of the if/else
    
Master
  Implement Rx WT Automation
  Implement automatic export to excel
  Implement Webservice/Webserver to provide actions such as 'Mittagspause now' to go into Mittagspause right after a Meeting
  Extend Propmt dialog in a way such that you can already define at least 2 projects
  Privat must be counted as Break
  Include "I did something else for 10mins but I am now continuing to work at the current Pj/Desktop"
  Always track Pause as Worktimebreaks and ajust to minimal Pause needed at the end of the day
    But that would mean that we kind of enforce this legal workbreaktime shit that actually nobody cares about#
  Implement global shortcut for "I was just x mins on a different project"
  Implement something that learns to infer your project from current windows or other stuff
  Ask for current screen instead(?) of initialization required

Bug/Features in New Implementation
  If workbreaktime is in unlock-events, it gets splitted up but no workbreaktime is deducted
  if workbreaktime is the last event of the unlock event, the current event also is workbreaktime (is probably true for all events)
  Do not set 0% entries in WT
  Guten Morgen does not work?
  Renaming does not work?
  Autoscroll of list to bottom or reverse sort
  Auto-adaption if != 100% implement, even if it's a crappy solution (e.g. just adapting a random workentry)
  2% other, 96% SalesF 1% AgD 1% PS adm -> 5% PS Adm & 95% SalesF ??!?
  Rename Solution
