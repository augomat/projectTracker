  Refactor Prompt out of NotifierLockscreen into Processor/Subscriber such that it can react to GoodMorning differently
    Therefor I probably need to introduce IDs into the Events so that I can react to the GoodMorning but not the the original Start
      That makes an explicit assumption about the order of processing of the events
      Or I just let GoodMorning change/set (and not refire) the event
  When coming back from a meeting, Bubble shouldn't Show 'Break: 88min'
  Fix 'Somethinig happened with project'

  Show Mins instead of secs in chart
  Worktimebreak left bubble should be in mins instead of secs
  Retrieve Outlook Appointments, check whether they fall into a Break and offer correction in case they do
